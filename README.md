# BOM Data Processing Project
This project was completed as part of Assignment 1 for the subject IFQ509 Data Exploration and Mining.

The project uses Python to process and clean a data set sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology, which contains 145,490 instances of weather records represented by 27 weather related variables collected over a period of 10 years.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Handling large datasets with 100K+ rows
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Jupyter Notebook documentation and workflow
- Clear structuring of code and outputs for readability
